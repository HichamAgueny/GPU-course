# GPU-course
This is a training course in GPU-programming with OpenACC including an overview of the hardware architectures (i.e. CPU vs GPU). The course involves hands-on and is physical. It took place in Bergen 29/03/2022.

The course contains slides, exercises and solutions. The content of the slides is split into two parts as described below: 

**0. Part 0**
   
   - State-of-the-art supercomputers 
   
**I. Part I**
   
   - CPU and GPU architectures (CPU vs GPU)
   
   - GPU-programming models and compiler supports
   
   - Functionality of OpenACC

**II. Part II**
   
   - Synchronous OpenACC 

   - Combining OpenACC with other programming models
   
   - Asynchronous OpenACC  
   
   - Code profiling

**III. Hands-on + discussion**
